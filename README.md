1. One team member creates a remote repository containing a Flask web-API project.
For convenience we call this team member the “admin” of the repository. 
2. Another team member takes responsibility for a graph database in neo4j. 
3. All team members should implement a part of the Flask web-API project which will be 
described in more detail. One of the purposes of this exercise is to practice 
collaborative work on GitHub, so all team members should clone the admin’s repo and 
create a local copy of the project on their computer.
4. The web-API's will interact with the graph database for storing information. 
5. Changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.
